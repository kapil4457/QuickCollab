# Quick Collab

A fully developed platform built to streamline collaboration between content
creators and creative professionals.

## **_🎯 What Quick Collab offers_**

### Job Portal

1. Creators can post and manage job listings
2. Applicants can apply and track their application statuses

### Content Management System

1. Team members can request media uploads to platforms like YouTube and Twitter
2. Designed to simplify internal workflows for content teams

<br />
💡 The goal with Quick Collab is to bring order and efficiency to the fast-paced world of digital content. Whether it's hiring creatives or managing media distribution, it’s built to support how real teams collaborate.

<br />
🛠️ The platform is fully developed but not deployed ( as it would cost money to
keep all the service running ). This is a walkthrough/demo of its features and
potential impact.

Would love to hear your thoughts, suggestions, or feedback!
